<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>
  Beaver Tracer is a learning tool that helps you understand how computer
  networks work — step by step.
</p>
<p>
  It gives you a <strong>simplified practice network</strong> (a
  <em>“didactically reduced”</em> network): enough to learn the important ideas,
  without all the confusing real-world noise.
</p>

<h3>What can I do with it?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>See how devices “talk” to each other</li>
  <li>Explore protocols and packets</li>
  <li>Follow what happens during a connection</li>
  <li>Learn how to read network traces</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real data, safe environment</h3>
<p>
  Even though the network is simplified, Beaver Tracer uses
  <strong>real protocol data</strong>. That means what you learn here can be
  transferred to real networks later.
</p>

<h3>The Tracer (Wireshark inside)</h3>
<p>
  Beaver Tracer includes a built-in tracer based on <strong>Wireshark</strong>
  technology. You can inspect real packets and learn how a professional tool
  looks and feels — but in a friendlier learning setup.
</p>

<h3>The Beaver 🦫</h3>
<p>
  Why a beaver? Because beavers are experts at building things carefully.
  That’s what you do here too: collect small pieces (packets) and turn them
  into understanding.
</p>

<h3>For Teachers</h3>
<p>
  Beaver Tracer was developed specifically for use in the classroom.
  The didactically reduced network makes it possible to teach core
  networking concepts in a clear and accessible way, without overwhelming
  learners with unnecessary details.
</p>
<p>
  <i>The accompanying <strong>teaching materials</strong> are currently in development.</i>
